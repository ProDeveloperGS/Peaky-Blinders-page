            <p>The Peaky Blinders were a street gang based in Birmingham, England, that operated from the end of the 19th century to the early 1900s. The group, which grew out of the harsh economic deprivations of working-class Britain, was composed largely of young men of lower to middle classes. They derived social power from robbery, violence, racketeering, illegal bookmaking, and the control of gambling. Members of this gang wore a signature outfit that included tailored jackets, lapel overcoats, button waistcoats, silk scarves, bell-bottom trousers, leather boots, and peaked flat caps.</p>
